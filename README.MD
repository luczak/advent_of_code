#Advent of code

### Description
This repo contains my solutions to advent of code problems.

### Files structure
They are grouped in directories depending on the year they were released in.
Actual solution script names are `part-one`, `part-two` or `part-one-and-two` if both assignment parts are solved by single script.
You may see files named differently, they are supplementary to the solution scripts.
`input.txt` files supply input generated by the website for the tasks in their directory.

### Tools
I used node 14.15.1 with npm  6.14.9 to run this project. It also uses eslint for linting.

### Notes
* ESlint doesn't support global scope await which I'm using here.
* I'm using es modules by setting `type: module` in package.json. This causes some node globals to not be defined ie `__dirname` or `__filename`. 
  I've defined some utility functions to work around this
