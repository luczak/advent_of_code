#Advent of code

### Description
This repo contains my solutions to advent of code problems.

They are grouped in directories depending on the year they were released in.
Actual solution script names are suffixed with `-task`.
`input.txt` files supply input generated by the website for the tasks in their directory.

### Tools
I used node 14.15.1 with npm  6.14.9 to run this project. It also uses eslint for linting.
